<lb/><p>My own inclination would
<lb/>lead me to say as little as possible
<lb/>about myself, but several 
<lb/>friends in whose judgement
<lb/>I have confidence have suggested
<lb/>that as the reader likes to
<lb/>know something about the
<lb/>author, a short account
<lb/>of my origin and early life
<lb/>would lend additional
<lb/>interest to this book - Such
<lb/>is my excuse for the
<lb/>following egotism, and if an
<lb/>apology be necessary for
<lb/>giving my genealogy I find
<lb/>it in the fact that it is
<lb/>not very long and contains
<lb/>only one event of which
<lb/>I have reason to be proud - </p>

<lb/><p>My grandfather could give 
<lb/>particulars of the lives of our
<lb/>ancestors for six generations
<lb/>of the family before him
<lb/>and the only point of the tradition
<lb/>I feel proud of is this - one of
<lb/>these poor hardy islanders
<lb/>was reknowned in the district 
<lb/>for great wisdom and prudence
<lb/>and when on his death-bed, it is
<lb/>related that he called all his 
<lb/>children around him and said,

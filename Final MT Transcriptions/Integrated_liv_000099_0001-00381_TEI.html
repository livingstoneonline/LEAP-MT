In 1857, he was deposed by Macheng but was restored the following year. He was removed in favour of his brother again in 1866, briefly resuming rule in 1872 before his son Khama III secured the leadership three years later. Khama was an enthusiastic Christian convert, and his beliefs proved a source of major conflict with his father (Parsons 1998:45-46; Lipschutz and Rasmussen 1986:209).">Sekomi</span>

Splitting with Shaka around 1820, he migrated north, conquering and assimilating a range of groups. Following collisions with Afrikaners in the Transvaal, he founded his kingdom, Matabeleland, in present-day Zimbabwe around 1840.

Dingane's major problem was the increased European presence in Natal as a result of the Great Trek and he became embroiled in conflict with the Boers under Andries Pretorius.

He rose to leadership around 1833 and built power and prestige by trading with visiting Europeans and extending commercial routes. He converted to Christianity soon after Livingstone arrived among the Kwena in 1846 and later became an important figure in the Christianisation of southern Africa. Sechele was also instrumental in the formation of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and in contesting the efforts of Transvaal Boers to appropriate his lands (Parsons 1998:37-42).">Sechele</span> - <span class="persName" title="Sekgoma Kgari I (c.1815-1883).

In 1857, he was deposed by Macheng but was restored the following year. He was removed in favour of his brother again in 1866, briefly resuming rule in 1872 before his son Khama III secured the leadership three years later. Khama was an enthusiastic Christian convert, and his beliefs proved a source of major conflict with his father (Parsons 1998:45-46; Lipschutz and Rasmussen 1986:209).">Sekomi</span> and <span class="persName" title="Letsholathebe I (c.1830-1874).

Letsholatebe remained under pressure from Sekeletu, until the Kololo were overthrown by the Lozi in 1864 (Lipschutz and Rasmussen 1986:121; Schapera 1963, 2: 277, 290).">Lechulatebe</span>

Livingstone’s second mission station, about fifteen miles south of present-day Gaborone in south-east Botswana. Livingstone established the mission in 1846 to develop his work among the Kwena people. He had also quarrelled with his colleague Roger Edwards at Mabotsa, their shared station. Chonuane was poorly resourced with water and so the Livingstones and the Kwena moved to Kolobeng in the following year (Ross 2002:51, 55; Schapera 1960:74n2).">Chonuane</span></placeName> while we

From Kolobeng, Livingstone journeyed to Lake Ngami (1849), and laid plans to make contact with Sebitwane (1851) and explore the Zambezi.

With David Livingstone, her husband, she established missions at Mabotsa, Chonuane, and Kolobeng and made an expedition to Lake Ngami (1850). During Livingstone's cross-contintental expedition, Mary spent several unhappy years in Britain. She travelled to central Africa to join the Zambezi expedition in 1862, but died shortly afterwards (Davidson 2012:XIII-XV).">M<span class="hi sup  ">rs</span> L-</span>

During the early period of European colonisation, it was applied to all Bantu-speaking Africans but in the nineteenth century it came to have its more specific application to the Xhosa. The term, however, continued to be used to generalise about Bantu peoples and is now considered derogatory. It has its origin in the Arabic word ‘kafir’, which means ‘unbeliever’ (Mills 1996:615).">Caffres</span> and <span class="add  below  " title="addition, place: below; ">^</span> <span class="add  above  " title="addition, place: above; ">as</span> it<span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: strikethrough; ">s</span> <span class="add  below  " title="addition, place: below; ">^</span> <span class="add  above  " title="addition, place: above; ">is</span> not

<lb/><p>Another effort has been made to attract
<lb/>commercial enterprise into this region by offering
<lb/>permission to any mining company, willing to
<lb/>search for the ores and work them, to do so.
<lb/>Such a company, however, would gain but little
<lb/>in the way of protection from the <orgName>government of
<lb/><placeName><country>Mozambique</country></placeName></orgName>, for it can itself but barely
<lb/>maintain a hold on its own small possessions,

<lb/><retrace hand="#DL" n="DL"><add place="inline" rend="gray" hand="#DL" n="DL">is impolitic</add></retrace>. Taxes would also be levied on the
<lb/>minerals exported by the company. It is
<lb/>noticeable that all the companies that have been
<lb/>proposed in <placeName><country>Portugal</country></placeName> have this put prominently
<lb/>in the preamble "And for the abolition of the 
<lb/>inhuman <orgName>slave trade</orgName>." This shows, either
<lb/>that the <term type="occupation">statesmen</term> in <placeName><country>Portugal</country></placeName> are enlightened
<lb/>and philanthropic, or it may be meant as a
<lb/>trap for <term type="nationality">English</term> capitalists, I incline to
<lb/>believe the former. But if the <term type="people">Portuguese</term>
<lb/>really wish to develop the resources of the
<lb/>rich country beyond their possessions, they
<lb/>ought to invite the cooperation of other
<lb/>nations on equal terms with themselves. Let

<lb/>and instead of wretched forts with scarcely
<lb/>an acre of land around them which they
<lb/>can call their own, let real colonies be
<lb/>made. If instead of military establishments
<lb/>we had civil ones, and saw emigrants going

    <lb/><p>The village of <placeName><settlement type="town"><choice><orig>Senna</orig><reg>Sena</reg></choice></settlement></placeName> stands on the right

<lb/>islands in front of it, and there is much bush
<lb/>in the country adjacent. The soil is fertile,
<lb/>but the village, being in a state of ruin, and

<lb/>which gives it a sombre appearance, but just
<lb/>in the haze of the horizon South West by South,
<lb/>there rises a mountain range equal in height to

<lb/><p>As far as I am myself concerned, the opening

<lb/>As I have elsewhere remarked, I view the end

<lb/>term in its most extended signification, and
<lb/>include every effort made for the amelioration

<lb/>and bringing all His dealings with man to
<lb/>a glorious consummation. Each man in his
<lb/>sphere, either knowingly or unwittingly, is
<lb/>performing the will of our Father in Heaven.

<lb/><term type="occupation">soldiers</term> battling for the right against
<lb/>tyranny,- <term type="occupation">sailors</term> rescuing the victims of
<lb/>oppression from the grasp of heartless <orgName><w>men-

<lb/>the highlands on the borders of the <placeName><region>central

<lb/>has not been surveyed, but at the time I
<lb/>came down, there was abundance of water
<lb/>for a large vessel and this continues to be
<lb/>the case during four or five months of each
<lb/>year. The months of low water still admit
<lb/>of navigation by launches, and would permit
<lb/>small vessels equal to the <orgName><placeName><geogName type="river">Thames</geogName></placeName> steamers</orgName>

<lb/>I would recommend one of the lightest draught,

<lb/>I advised them to go back to <placeName><settlement type="town">Tete</settlement></placeName> where food
<lb/>was abundant, and there await my return.
<lb/>I bought a quantity of cotton cloth and brass

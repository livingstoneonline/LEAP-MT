However, fuelled by discriminatory Cape policy and land dispossession, the settlement unexpectedly refused to support the Cape Colony in 1851 during the Eighth Xhosa War, with a considerable proportion joining the Xhosa forces.

He was the eldest son of the former Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, Lord Charles Somerset. He entered the army in 1811 and joined the Cape Mounted Rifles in South Africa in 1818. He was regularly involved in the Xhosa wars over the next thirty-five years. As commanding officer, Somerset's military excursions made him controversial with evangelical humanitarians. Following the 8th Xhosa War (1850–53), he left the Cape and was stationed in Bombay (Anon 1862b:499; Lester 2001:41-42).">General Somerset</span>

While Colonial Secretary (1835-39), he collided with the Cape governor, Benjamin D'Urban, over policy in South Africa. As part of British humanitarian circles he disapproved of D'Urban's conduct in the Xhosa wars, refusing to approve the annexation of Xhosa territories in the Ciskei and removing the governor from his post (Martin 2008; Etheringon 2001:245).">Glenelg</span> treaties, was "<span class="orgName" title="Kaffir.

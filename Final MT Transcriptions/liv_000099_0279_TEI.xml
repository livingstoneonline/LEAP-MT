<lb/>from heathenism by modern
<lb/><term type="occupation">missionaries</term> it becomes
<lb/>an interesting question whether
<lb/>their faith possesses the
<lb/>elements of permanence 
<lb/>or is only an exotic too
<lb/>tender for self propagation
<lb/>when the fostering care
<lb/>of the foreign cultivators
<lb />is withdrawn - If habits
<lb/>of self reliance are not both
<lb/>sedulously cultivated and
<lb/>opportunities given for
<lb/>the exercise of that virtue
<lb/>the most promising converts
<lb/>are apt to become like
<lb/>spoiled children - In <placeName><country>Madagascar</country></placeName>
<lb/>a few <orgName>Christians</orgName> were
<lb/>left with nothing but the
<lb/><bibl>bible</bibl> in their hands
<lb/>and though exposed to
<lb/>persecution and even
<lb/>death itself as the penalty
<lb/>of adherence to their profession
<lb/>they increased tenfold
<lb/>in numbers and are if
<lb/>possible more decided

<lb/>they were when by an edict of
<lb/>the <term target="occupation">queen</term> of that island<!-- country Madagascar. SH --> the
<lb/><term type="occupation">missionaries</term> ceased their
<lb/>teaching - </p>
<lb/><p>In <placeName><region>South Africa</region></placeName> such
<lb/>an experiment could not
<lb/>be made for such a variety
<lb/>of <term type="faith">Christian</term> sects have followed
<lb/>the footsteps of <choice><sic><orgName>the London

<lb/>thus more likely to become
<lb/>spoiled children than trained
<lb/>to the manly <term type="faith">Christian</term> virtues</p>
<lb/>
<lb/><p>Another element of weakness
<lb/>in the part of the <term type="occupation">missionary</term>
<lb/>field is the fact of Missionary
<lb/>Societies considering the Colony<!-- reference to the Cape Colony. SH -->
<lb/>a proper sphere for their peculiar

<lb/>it is deeply to be regretted that
<lb/>so much honest zeal
<lb/>should be so lavishly expended
<lb/>in a district whenever there
<lb/>is so little scope for success<!-- full stop occurs in printed work. sh -->
<lb/>When we hear an agent
<lb/>of one sect urging his
<lb/>friends at home to aid
<lb/>him quickly to occupy some
<lb/>unimportant nook because
<lb/>if it is not speedily laid
<lb/>hold of he will "not
<lb/>have room for the sole of
<lb/>his foot" one cannot help
<lb/>longing that both he and
<lb/>his friends should direct
<lb/>their noble aspirations to
<lb/>the millions of true Heathen
<lb/>in the regions beyond - and
<lb/>no longer continue to make
<lb/>the extremity of the continent
<lb/>as it were into a dam
<lb/>of benevolence</p>
<lb/>
<lb/><p>I would earnestly
<lb/>recommend all young
<lb/><term type="occupation">missionaries</term> to go at once
<lb/><del type="strikethrough">on</del> to the real heathen and

<lb/><p>And the principle might

<lb/>Societies that one ordinary

<lb/>should be considered an

<lb/>A <term type="occupation">missionary</term> is soon
<lb/>known to be supported by
<lb/>his friends at home - and
<lb/>though the salary is but a
<lb/>bare subsistence to <orgName>Africans</orgName>
<lb/>it seems an enormous sum
<lb/>and being unable to appreciate
<lb/>the motives by which he is
<lb/>actuated they consider <w>them-

<lb/>services at his hands and
<lb/>themselves defrauded if they
<lb/>are not duly rendered - This
<lb/>feeling is all the stronger

Livingstone came to the same view of Africa’s continental structure during his cross-continental expedition, and considered his observations to provide empirical confirmation of Murchison’s proposition (Stafford 1988:8, 17; Murchison 1852:cxxii; Livingstone 1857:475, 500; Schapera 1963, 2:314).">central humid basin of Africa</span></placeName>

In 1857, he was deposed by Macheng but was restored the following year. He was removed in favour of his brother again in 1866, briefly resuming rule in 1872 before his son Khama III secured the leadership three years later.

<lb/>is patriarchal, each man being

<lb/>If you meet a party of strangers and

<lb/>proclaimed by his attendants you

<lb/><p><persName>Sechele</persName> was thus firmly seated
<lb/>in his <term type="occupation">chieftainship</term> when I made
<lb/>his acquaintance, On the first
<lb/>occasion in which I ever
<lb/>attempted to hold a public religious
<lb/>service he remarked that it was
<lb/>their custom when any new
<lb/>subject was brought before them
<lb/>to put questions on it - and he
<lb/>begged me to allow him to do the same
<lb/>in this case, On expressing my
<lb/>entire willingness to answer
<lb/>him - He enquired if my forefathers
<lb/>knew of a future judgment, I replied
<lb/>in the affirmative and began to
<lb/>describe the scene of the "great white
<lb/>throne and him who shall sit on
<lb/>it from whose face the heaven
<lb/>and earth shall flee away - " &amp;c.
<lb/>He said "You startle me - these words
<lb/>make all my bones to shake
<lb/>I have no more strength in me - "
<lb/>but my forefathers were living
<lb/>at the same time yours were
<lb/>and how is it they did not
<lb/>send word about these terrible
<lb/>things sooner? They all passed

and
<lb/>he invariably made an offer

<lb/>Seeing me anxious that his people

<lb/>he said once "Do you imagine

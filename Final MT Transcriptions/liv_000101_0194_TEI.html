Roderick Murchison, the president of the Royal Geographical Society, had proposed in 1852 that the physical structure of southern Africa was an elevated ‘central trough or basin’ encircled by a highland ridge. Although based on limited information and mistaken geological premises, his theoretical speculation proved largely correct. Livingstone came to the same view of Africa’s continental structure during his cross-continental expedition, and considered his observations to provide empirical confirmation of Murchison’s proposition (Stafford 1988:8, 17; Murchison 1852:cxxii; Livingstone 1857:475, 500; Schapera 1963, 2:314).">central basin</span></placeName>

Member of the Kololo, who led Livingstone's retinue from Linyanti to Mozambique (1855–1856). He performed an important role as intermediary with local groups, having travelled the routes extensively. He was probably Ndebele, being described in Livingstone’s journals as ‘Letibele Mokololo’. He sailed to Mauritius with Livingstone, but drowned himself towards the end of the crossing. Livingstone was deeply affected by his death, experiencing 'the sorrow of the loss of a very good friend’ (Schapera 1963, 2:331; letter to Robert Moffat, 17th Aug 1856).">Sekwébu</span> and from one of

The name Changamire subsequently became a hereditary title of the Rozvi dynasty. The state gave way in the 1830s with the ascendancy of Nguni groups (Msindo 2012:58-59; Lipschutz and Rasmussen 1986:46; Shillington 1989:204-06).">Changaméra</span>’s people who lives at <span class="del cancelled" title="deletion, type: cancelled; ">Ly</span> <placeName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" full="yes"><span xmlns="" class="settlement town" title="Linyanti.

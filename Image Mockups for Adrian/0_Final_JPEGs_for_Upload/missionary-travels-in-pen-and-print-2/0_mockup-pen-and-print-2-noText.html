Cory, The Rise of South Africa: A History of the Origin of South African Colonisation and its Development Towards the East from the Earliest Times to 1857, 6 vols (London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1926), 4:frontispiece. Courtesy of the Internet Archive. This scene depicts negotiations between Colonel John Hare and the AmaXhosa chief, Sandile, which took place in early 1846 prior to the outbreak of the Seventh Cape Frontier War. The illustration, which portrays Sandile as a "noble savage," provides insight into mid-nineteenth century representations of the AmaXhosa. More specifically, the imagery connects Sandile to classical antiquity, a link that dignifies the AmaXhosa but also portrays them as a people belonging to an earlier period of history (see Lester 2001:55).</p><br/><br/>

This scene commemorates the stand of the 74th Highlanders against an AmaXhosa ambush that took place in September 1851, during the Eighth Cape Frontier War, as the British regiment withdrew following an incursion into the Waterkloof Highlands of the Eastern Cape. The illustration thus valorises British defence against the guerrilla tactics of the AmaXhosa forces.</p><br/><br/>

While he worked on Missionary Travels in 1857, Livingstone also made arrangements for a major government-supported journey to central Africa: the Zambezi Expedition (1858-64). On this expedition, Livingstone led a team of six Europeans with the remit of investigating the natural resources and opportunities for British trade on the Zambezi River. The Ma-Robert was a steamer built by Macgregor Laird for river transportation, but which proved unsatisfactory in navigating shallow sections of the Zambezi.</p><br/><br/>

Illustration from Missionary Travels (Livingstone 1857aa:opposite 332), detail. Courtesy of the Internet Archive. The illustrations included in Missionary Travels contributed to the book’s popularity and helped establish the iconic imagery that would become associated with Livingstone. For instance, some of the book’s illustrations, including the scene above, provided the basis for a series of magic lantern slides published by John Murray (c.1857).

This frontispiece provides an example of how Livingstone – and African exploration more broadly – were mediated to the public in popular biographies.</p><br/><br/>

John Murray heightened public anticipation for Livingstone's Missionary Travels by releasing regular trade adverts in the months preceding the book's publication. Since Livingstone took longer to complete the book than anticipated, Murray also used these adverts to retain public interest and to contest other publishers who took advantage of the delay by publishing "unofficial" narratives of Livingstone's travels.</p><br/><br/>

Deane, Robert Moffat the Missionary Hero of Kuruman, second edition (New York, Chicago: Fleming H. Revell, c.1880), 61. This image, which dramatises the dangers of intercultural encounter, highlights an established tradition of representing mission as a heroic enterprise; this tradition would contribute to the crafting of Livingstone's public persona.</p><br/><br/>

Courtesy of the Internet Archive. Although Livingstone’s transcontinental expedition was supported by the leader of the Makololo, Sekeletu, members of the Makololo rarely appear in illustrated or pictorial form in contemporaneous and posthumous Livingstone biographies. The photograph above represents a rare deviation from the general trend. However, Johnston's caption (“A Ma-kololo”) both ignores one of the individuals and presents the other as only a generic representative of the Makololo group as a whole, and so follows patterns of representation for non-European peoples that appear in many imperial-era works. The corresponding narrative text does not identify the two individuals or indicate if either travelled with Livingstone.</p><br/><br/>

In composing Missionary Travels, Livingstone returned to the notebooks and journals that he had kept during his first period in southern Africa (1841-56). The pages from this notebook contain an early draft of Livingstone’s famous dialogue with the rainmaker. This dialogue later appeared (with revisions) in Missionary Travels (see Livingstone 1857aa:23-25).</p><br/><br/>

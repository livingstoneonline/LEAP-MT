These segments are indicative of the editorial interventions that the “red ink man,” probably the reviser John Milton, made to Livingstone’s manuscript. In the top segment, the reviser queries the passage using the marginal annotation “Qu” and suggests two textual transpositions. In the bottom segment, he adds a final sentence for the sake of clarity and expression to bring the paragraph to a close.</p><br/><br/>

In this letter, Livingstone provides an example of what he considered to be illegitimate changes made to the galley proofs of Missionary Travels by the literary reviser.

Illustration from Roualeyn Gordon Cumming, Five Years’ Hunting in South Africa, Complete Popular edition (London: Simpkin, Marshall & Co, 1892), opposite 284. Courtesy of the Internet Archive. The portion of text that Livingstone sent to his publisher as evidence of stylistic “emasculation” (see above), indicates that he was critical of “shooting by night” because it resulted in the needless wounding of animals. This was a practice, as seen in the above illustration, that was engaged in by Gordon-Cumming, one of the most famous big-game hunters of the nineteenth century. Livingstone was critical of hunting for sport in general: when hunters “fired away indiscriminately […] all for the sole purpose of making a ‘bag,’ then I take it to be evident that such sportsmen are pretty far gone in the hunting form of insanity” (Livingstone 1857aa:161-62).</p><br/><br/>

Although Livingstone criticised trophy hunting in his writings, the prominent rhinoceros horn in this photograph connects him with the characteristics that contemporaries associated with big-game hunting, including bravery, virility, and composure.</p><br/><br/>

May not be reproduced without the express written consent of the National Trust for Scotland, on behalf of the Scottish National Memorial to David Livingstone Trust. Livingstone travelled with a complement of scientific instruments, including this microscope. He was a keen field scientist, who gathered environmental data from the regions through which he travelled and who collected zoological, botanical and geological specimens which he sent to British metropolitan institutions. Livingstone’s publishing correspondence, such as his letters to Joseph Hooker (1857y, 1857z), indicate his concern to avoid scientific error in Missionary Travels and to demonstrate his credentials in natural history.</p><br/><br/>

			<p style="font:11px; font-family: Arial" align="left">Camp in Ovampo Land. Illustration from Francis Galton, The Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical South Africa (London: John Murray, 1853), opposite 210. Francis Galton travelled in southern Africa between 1850 and 1852. He received a gold medal from the Royal Geographical Society on the publication of his travelogue and subsequently wrote an expeditionary handbook, The Art of Travel (1855). The illustration above foregrounds Galton’s competence in African travel by showcasing his equipment and the layout of his encampment. It was this reputed expertise that prompted Livingstone to consider Galton as a reviser for Missionary Travels before securing Norton Shaw.</p><br/><br/>

Courtesy of the Internet Archive. When Livingstone received the proofs of this illustration, he complained to John Murray that it portrayed the members of his retinue “all stark naked.” “Is it impossible,” he wrote, “ to put on a rag round the lions [sic] of these fellows? All wear something except the Batoka.” Livingstone’s comment shows a striking awareness of the tendency in contemporary travel texts to exoticise African bodies. It is likely that the illustration above, in which each subject is wearing a small garment, is an amended version of the plate.</p><br/><br/>

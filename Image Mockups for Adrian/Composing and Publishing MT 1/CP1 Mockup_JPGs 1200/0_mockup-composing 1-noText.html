Murdoch, 1870), frontispiece. Courtesy of the Internet Archive. Although exploration was a scientific enterprise involving official reports and extensive documentation, geographical expeditions were also celebrated in popular culture. This image provides an example of how Livingstone, and African exploration more broadly, were mediated to the public in popular biography.</p><br/><br/>

Fold out map from Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa (Livingstone 1857aa:n.p.), detail. Courtesy of the Internet Archive. Producing published expeditionary narratives involved the expertise of multiple individuals. On the basis of Livingstone’s records, John Arrowsmith, one of Britain’s leading cartographers, prepared this map along with another tracing the route of the transcontinental journey for inclusion in Missionary Travels.</p><br/><br/>

Courtesy of the Internet Archive. Although Livingstone’s transcontinental expedition was supported by Sekeletu, the Makololo are rarely pictured in the numerous Livingstone biographies. The image above is a rare instance of an illustration based on a photograph. Johnston, however, presents these individuals as representatives of an ethnic group without noting their names or providing any further information. It is not clear if either travelled with Livingstone.</p><br/><br/>

B Dawson, Livingstone the Hero of Africa (London: Seely, Service & Co., 1918), opposite 32. Courtesy of the Internet Archive. Livingstone’s working class background has been romanticised by many of his biographers, who have interpreted him as an exemplar of Victorian self-improvement. This artistic representation of Livingstone’s family home, which was tenement housing provided for Blantyre cotton mill employees, participates in the idealisation of workers’ conditions in nineteenth-century industrial Scotland.</p><br/><br/>

These two reproductions of early photographs of Blantyre provide an alternative perspective on the conditions of Livingstone’s early life to the artistic representation above. On beginning work in 1823 at the Blantyre cotton mill, run by Monteith, Bogle and Co., Livingstone joined a substantial child work force employed by Scottish industry (see Mullen 2013:19).</p><br/>

Images from Lantern Slides of the Life, Adventures, and Work of David Livingstone (London Missionary Society c.1900:[3]-[4]). Images courtesy of the Smithsonian Libraries, Washington, D.C. The London Missionary Society participated in cultivating Livingstone’s posthumous reputation by producing a series of thirty-nine magic lantern slides showing iconic moments from his life. The inclusion of Livingstone’s audience with Queen Victoria, shown here beside Victoria Falls, indicates that propriety and respectability were characteristics that the London Missionary Society, like the John Murray publishing house, aimed to associate with one of its representatives.</p><br/>

(Philadelphia, Boston, and Cincinnati: Hubbard Bros., 1875), 69. Courtesy of the Internet Archive. The indigenous hunter-gatherer peoples of southern Africa, known collectively as the San, were historically called the Bushmen (now often considered pejorative). As descriptions of the Kalahari peoples circulated from the 1840s, following the journeys of European travellers through the region, the San became the subject of much speculative evolutionary science. The illustration above indicates that the San’s semi-nomadic lifestyle attracted racial stereotyping in nineteenth-century literature.</p><br/><br/>

Courtesy of the Internet Archive. Robert Moffat, who became Livingstone’s father-in-law, began work with the London Missionary Society among the southern BaTswana in 1816. He was one of the missionaries, preceding Livingstone, who considered BaTswana initiation rites to be an obstacle to the introduction of Christianity.</p><br/><br/>

Murdoch, 1870), frontispiece. Courtesy of the Internet Archive. Livingstone first crossed the Kalahari to reach Lake Ngami in 1849, with William Cotton Oswell and Mungo Murray. In 1850 and 1851, Livingstone made two more journeys through the Kalahari with the aim of going further north to the Makololo. On the second of these expeditions, undertaken with Oswell, Livingstone reached the Makololo and then continued north for his first sighting of the Zambezi River.</p><br/><br/>

Kuruman was established by Robert and Mary Moffat in the 1820s as a mission to the BaTlhaping (a BaTswana group) and became the centre of London Missionary Society activities in the region. Prior to the mission stations built by Livingstone in the 1840s, Kuruman was the furthest north of the LMS missions in southern Africa.</p><br/><br/>

The criticisms of George Cathcart on this manuscript page are marked up both by Livingstone and the editor, John Milton. The question mark and initials at margin left are in Livingstone’s hand. Milton’s marginal comment in red ink consists of an abbreviation of the word “query” along with “stet,” a proof correction mark for “let it stand.” The precise meaning of Milton’s annotation is unclear, but it is evident that he had reservations about retaining the passage.</p><br/>

Splitting with Shaka around 1820, he migrated north, conquering and assimilating a range of groups. Following collisions with Afrikaners in the Transvaal, he founded his kingdom, Matabeleland, in present-day Zimbabwe around 1840.

Dingane's major problem was the increased European presence in Natal as a result of the Great Trek and he became embroiled in conflict with the Boers under Andries Pretorius.

He rose to leadership around 1833 and built power and prestige by trading with visiting Europeans and extending commercial routes. He converted to Christianity soon after Livingstone arrived among the Kwena in 1846 and later became an important figure in the Christianisation of southern Africa. Sechele was also instrumental in the formation of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and in contesting the efforts of Transvaal Boers to appropriate his lands (Parsons 1998:37-42).">Sechele</span> - <span class="persName" title="Sekgoma Kgari I (c.1815-1883). Chief of the Ngwato. He rose to power in 1834, after a succession dispute with his brother Macheng. Following the Kololo invasion, he reunited the divided Ngwato. In 1857, he was deposed by Macheng but was restored the following year. He was removed in favour of his brother again in 1866, briefly resuming rule in 1872 before his son Khama III secured the leadership three years later. Khama was an enthusiastic Christian convert, and his beliefs proved a source of major conflict with his father (Parsons 1998:45-46; Lipschutz and Rasmussen 1986:209).">Sekomi</span> and <span class="persName" title="Letsholathebe I (c.1830-1874).

When Letsholatebe became chief, he consolidated the Tawana around Lake Ngami and established trade with the west coast. As Livingstone records, the Kololo attacked the Tawana in 1854. Letsholatebe remained under pressure from Sekeletu, until the Kololo were overthrown by the Lozi in 1864 (Lipschutz and Rasmussen 1986:121; Schapera 1963, 2: 277, 290).">Lechulatebe</span>

In 1849, he and Mungo Murray joined Livingstone in the cross-Kalahari journey to reach Lake Ngami. Oswell funded and helped manage the expedition. In 1851, he joined Livingstone on his journey to the Kololo chief, Sebitwane, and to the Zambezi river (Seccombe 2004).">M<span class="hi sup  ">r</span> <span class="sic diplomatic" title="The editors suggest a correction as follows: Oswell">Oswel</span></span> should explore

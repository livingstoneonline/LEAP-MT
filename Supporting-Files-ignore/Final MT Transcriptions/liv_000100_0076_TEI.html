The term, however, continued to be used to generalise about Bantu peoples and is now considered derogatory. It has its origin in the Arabic word ‘kafir’, which means ‘unbeliever’ (Mills 1996:615).">Caffre</span> tribe

    <br/>The great chief <span class="persName" title="Moshoeshoe I (c.1786-1870). Founder and king of the Basuto nation. Originally a minor chief in the Caledon valley, he attracted Sesotho-speaking refugees dispersed during the Mfecane. He became one of the most effective leaders in nineteenth-century southern Africa, establishing a major state in the area of present-day Lesotho. From the 1840s he clashed with Afrikaners, which escalated following the creation of the Orange Free State. Border disputes with the Boer republic compelled him to appeal to Britain for protectorate status, which was introduced in 1868 (Lipschutz and Rasmussen 1986:153-54; Saunders 2012:268).">Moshesh</span>

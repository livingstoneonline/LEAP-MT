He was appointed by Major Tito Augusto d’Araujo Sicard to escort Livingstone from Tete to Quelimane between 22nd April and 20th May 1856. He later became a trader and was killed in action fighting Bonga (António Vicente da Cruz), a powerful Afro-Portuguese estate-holder in the Zambezi valley (Anon 1867:132; Schapera 1963, 2:455n4).">Mira<span class="del-by-over-text" title="deletion, hand: #DL; ">n</span><span class="add  overtext DL" title="addition, hand: #DL; place: over-text; ">

Livingstone came to the same view of Africa’s continental structure during his cross-continental expedition, and considered his observations to provide empirical confirmation of Murchison’s proposition (Stafford 1988:8, 17; Murchison 1852:cxxii; Livingstone 1857:475, 500; Schapera 1963, 2:314).">central basin</span></placeName> very

His reign was troubled by inter-Kololo rivalry and developing resistance from the Lozi community under his dominion. He supported Livingstone’s transcontinental expedition (1852-56) in the hope of extending trade routes. A London Missionary Society mission to the Kololo in the 1860s resulted in the majority of the members dying from fever, with Sekeletu wrongly suspected of having poisoned the party. The Lozi overthrew the Kololo and restored their independence shortly after his death (Lipschutz and Rasmussen 1986:208-09).">Sekeletu</span>

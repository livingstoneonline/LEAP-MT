1) <anchor xml:id="reorder-40"> is  used twice. Every other anchor xml:id is only used once.

2) For <add>, you have a number of instances of place="marginbottom" (19 instances) and one of place="margintop". We don't use these values so please correct. You could probably get away with "inspace".

3) You have only one <add hand="#U4> and one <add hand="#U5>. Double check that these are correct. 

4) You have one <add hand="#U8>. This clearly needs to be fixed.

5) You have the following: 
<date when="--03">
<date when="--04">
<date when="--05">
<date when="--06">
<date when="--08">
<date when="--09">
What is this?

6) You have one of each of these:
<del cert="high">
<del cert="medium">
Is @cert necessary? I suggest remove.

6) There is one instance of <metamark xml:id="meta-202">. Is this correct? You usually use @spanTo.

7) You have one instace of <note place="marginbottom">. Is this correct? We don't use the "marginbottom" value, so try to use something else.

8) You have "Fleet Street" as a <settlement>. That should really be just <placeName> without the <settlement> subtag. Plus a street isn't a settlement.

            <p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>We discussed this issue by email, so I&#39;m ticketing it here. I&#39;d like to turn on tooltips for all additions and deletions, so that when you hover over them you get the basic info (hand, colour, and perhaps even place).</p>
<p>I notice that a tooltip currently appears for del, when it is made in the default hand. However, it doesn&#39;t seem to show up when there&#39;s additional info in the tag (i.e. another hand and another colour).</p>
<p>It would be great if we could try this out - and we can see how the clashes with other tooltips work out. Thanks Adrian.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Can you point me to a specific file and give me a few examples of additions and deletions to examine? Also an example of what you point out: &quot;I notice that a tooltip currently appears for del, when it is made in the default hand. However, it doesn&#39;t seem to show up when there&#39;s additional info in the tag (i.e. another hand and another colour).&quot;</p>

          </div>
          <div class="body"><p>No problem! Let&#39;s go for file liv_000099_0092 (the first that has additions by unknown hand 3). The first page, 0092, provides enough examples I think</p>
<p>For an example of the tooltip successfully working on del hover over any of the words scored out in black (line 35 &#39;commenced&#39;, line 47 &#39;became&#39;, and line 48 &#39;related&#39;). In all these cases, there&#39;s a tooltip noting &#39;deletion, type:cancelled&#39;.</p>
<p>Then hover over any of the deletions in red (line 15 &#39;charge of that which, line 21 &#39;the crime is&#39;). In these cases, no tooltip appears.</p>
<p>No tooltip currently appears for any additions:
For a sample addition in DL&#39;s hand on 0092, see line 12 &#39;This did not arise&#39; and line 29 &#39;River&#39;. </p>
<p>For a sample addition in U2&#39;s hand, see the page number &#39;86&#39; at the top of the page. See also the name &#39;Coultart&#39; in line 2 (though it already has a tooltip noting an uncertain reading).</p>
<p>For a sample addition in U3 hand, see any of the words in red. For example line 15 &#39;that crime&#39;, line 18 &#39;charged&#39; and line 21 &#39;It is in fact&#39;.</p>
<p>For all these cases, I&#39;d like something similar to the tooltip currently working on del (working for the default hand only). In other words, something like &#39;deletion, type:cancelled, hand:Unknown Hand 3, rend:red&#39; or &#39;addition, place:margin left, hand:Unknown Hand 2, rend:gray&#39;.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help with this! It would be pretty cool to get this to work.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Ok, fixed. This was easy as it was just a matter of adding a specific code to all the examples of del or add in the xsl. </p>
<p>All the examples you&#39;ve cited above now work, except &quot;Coultart&quot; which is also correctly working except that the add tag is trumped (yargh! that word again!) by the uncertain tag.</p>
<p>Note: the add code adds &quot;ition&quot; to &quot;add&quot; to produce &quot;addition&quot;. The del code adds &quot;etion&quot; to &quot;del&quot; to produce &quot;deletion&quot;. (Just FYI if you end up using this code again.)</p>

<p>In thanks, I&#39;ll promise not to use the word &#39;trumped&#39; for at least a week...!</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>Sorry to open this again, but I have a follow up question. You might remember that in volume 3, we added an <code>&quot;n&quot;</code> attribute to additions and deletions, when we were working out a way of doing all the colour/hand variants. So there are lots of <code>n=&quot;CL&quot;</code> and <code>n=&quot;DL&quot;</code> etc. </p>
<p>This means that the titles on add and del are also showing this. i.e. &quot;addition, hand: #DL; n: DL; place: above.&quot; For an example, you can see on the words &#39;hawked about&#39; in line 20 on liv_000101_0083.</p>
<p>Is there are way to stop the tooltip title giving the &quot;n&quot; information? If not, I can live with it! I suspect it has something to do with this part of the code:
<code>&lt;xsl:attribute name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;concat(name(), &#39;etion, &#39;)&quot;/&gt;
&lt;xsl:for-each select=&quot;@*&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:sort/&gt;
&lt;xsl:if test=&quot;not(name()=&#39;status&#39;)&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;concat(name(),&#39;: &#39;, ., &#39;; &#39;)&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:if&gt;
&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
&lt;/xsl:attribute&gt;</code></p>

          <div class="body"><p>This one turned out to be easy. </p>
<p>Basically, you need to find all relevant instances of </p>
<p><code>select=&quot;@*&quot;</code> </p>
<p>then change them as follows: </p>
<p><code>select=&quot;@*[not(name()=&#39;n&#39;)]&quot;</code> </p>
<p>The fix I did fixed &quot;hawked about,&quot; so you need to do the others.</p>

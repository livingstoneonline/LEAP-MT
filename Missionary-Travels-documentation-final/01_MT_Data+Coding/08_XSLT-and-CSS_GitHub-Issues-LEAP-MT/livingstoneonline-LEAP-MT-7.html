            <p>Please resync. I&#39;ve updated the CSS and XSL. These are not done yet, so no need to start checking them. Rather, could you:</p>
<p>1) Clean up our MT Github folder and get rid of everything that&#39;s not necessary or at least move it into a subfolder called &quot;done&quot; or something like that?</p>
<p>2) Please put up a few real (not test) MT files. I need to test a few things and would like to work with what you&#39;ll actually be using.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Thanks Adrian. I&#39;ve cleaned up the folder, getting rid of everything aside from a file (liv_015006) that looks like one of yours. I can&#39;t remember why we put it there so decided to leave it for you.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve put 6 of my MT files into the github folder. As well as four files in DL&#39;s hand, the last two (from 000101) are in different hands: that of Charles and #U5. Together, they cover everything.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help with this.</p>

I&#39;ve just done so, so hopefully you&#39;ll have the files now.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>OK, resync. It&#39;s over to you for review. I think this is looking good. A couple of notes:</p>
<p>1) You&#39;ll notice that the header doesn&#39;t quite work right in relation to the text on liv_000101_0194_TEI. Just ignore that. It will work when we integrate all the files into longer ones.</p>
<p>2) I turned off the italics on Charles and U5 as it was messing up a bunch of stuff. Italics is not the way we&#39;ll go with differentiating anyway.</p>
<p>3) I don&#39;t like how far things are floating out in the left margin, but also don&#39;t see a way to fix this. I&#39;ve brought in everything a touch, so it&#39;s slightly better but it&#39;d be nice to see this improved even more. Any ideas? The only other thing I can think of (very minor) is reducing the font size of the things in the left margin to 90%.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>This is great. I&#39;ll review it more detail soon, but it looks good so far.</p>
<p>In answer to 2, I agree that turning off italics is the right move. I&#39;ll have a look at some other fonts and will run it by you.</p>
<p>As for 3, I agree the notes float a bit far to the left. I think one reason they need to be quite far over is because there are a few notes in which the lines are quite long, and they screw up the body of the text when they&#39;re too close. I&#39;d certainly like them to appear closer in general, if possible. I like the idea of reducing the size to 90%. </p>

          <div class="body"><p>OK, great. Let me know. If all looks OK overall, then we should move to sorting out the various lesser issues, and you can make separate tickets for those. For #2, don&#39;t worry about that too much right now. That will be easy to sort out when we get to it. For #3, go ahead and make it font-size:.9em for the things floating in the margin &amp; see if that looks OK with you. I marked most of the things in the CSS that need to be changed in this respect with /<em>Changed by AW</em>/ but you should see if I missed anything. Finally, note that the XSL has a handful of queries/action items for you.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>A small issue with this one. I&#39;ve made font-size .9m for things floating in the margin (i.e. <code>note.marginleft).</code> The problem is that this also makes every piece of text added in the margin appear .9 as well (i.e. any text that has <code>add.marginleft</code>). This means that words appearing in the body of the text in square brackets - signalling they&#39;re from the margin - are also being reduced in size.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried putting 1em on <code>add.marginleft</code> and .9 on <code>note.marginleft</code> but it seems to choose one or the other. I suspect this is because all my notes in the marginleft are also within an <code>add</code> tag...</p>
<p>This might not be a problem. Maybe it looks good to have text added from the margin appearing in a smaller font. It might be another way, in addition to square brackets, to signal the text is from another part of the page. What do you think?</p>
<p>Any of the files in github will give examples of this issue.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="body"><p>And I think I&#39;ve resolved this. Please resync and check. If it looks correct, then the next step is to take the things in the left margin and bring them in. For that I&#39;ll need some examples where there&#39;s a lot of/maximum text in the left margin so I can test just how much max the text can be brought in.</p>

            <p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>As I proof the MT conversion, I&#39;ve come across one small recurring issue. When a metamark floating in the margin is deleted, the strikethrough is not showing.</p>
<p>Resync github to see a test file I&#39;ve uploaded, &#39;Metamark deletion tests&#39;, which gives a number of examples. As you can see, when the metamark forms part of a note floating in the margin, the deletion works fine. Equally, when metamarks are not floating but are instead in the body of the text, the deletion also works. It&#39;s only an issue with metamarks floating in the margin on their own. Any ideas?</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Resync. Resolved for the latter two issues in the file, but not for that big slash. Is that slash also supposed to have a line through? I&#39;m not sure why the other two are working but not the big slash.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Thanks Adrian. The problem with this solution is that it doesn&#39;t recognise deletions in different colours. So when a value of <code>rend=&quot;red&quot;</code> is added to <code>del</code>, the deletion doesn&#39;t appear at all. It turns out this is the problem with the big slash. If you take away the <code>rend</code> value, the deletion will appear.</p>
<p>The solution for this problem needs to accommodate the colour variations that we currently have for <code>del</code>, for which there are instructions in xsl (i.e. red line through black word; black line through red word; gray through red, and so on). I wonder if we need a template for <code>metamark</code> with a parent/ancestor of <code>del</code>? Or should we try to do it through css?</p>
<p> It&#39;s strange that the problem only appears when the metamarks are in the margin.</p>

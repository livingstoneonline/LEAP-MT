            <p>Hi Adrian,</p>
<p>I&#39;m beginning to ticket remaining issues in the transcriptions. The good news is that I&#39;ve found very little; mostly it&#39;s just requiring a little xml tidy up. There&#39;s one issue I&#39;ve spotted a couple of times though. </p>
<p>To have a look, go into the MT github where all my transcriptions are in a folder, Final MT Transcriptions. Sync github first because I just a big tidy up in there! </p>
<p>The issue is that an unusual gap is appearing between paragraphs on page liv_000100_0071 (in file liv_000100_0053). I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s causing it, but I suspect it&#39;s to do with the milestone earlier in the page.</p>
<p>We opened an issue back in April on a similar problem on a different page, liv_000099_0244 (in file iv_000099_0229). Initially, I thought this was to do with the marginal metamark, but I can see that there&#39;s a milestone on the previous page (0243).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Here&#39;s the text from #9 since this looks like the same thing:</p>
<p>JL: &quot;Transform liv_000099_0229, and then look at 0244. The big space between paragraphs, just before the placeMark metamark and the words ‘The slow pace’ shouldn’t be there. I can’t spot the problem. This doesn’t occur elsewhere in the volume. The quick fix is to remove the paragraph break and indent using spaces.&quot;</p>

<p>Nigel and I hit this same issue (although it might not seem like it from immediate context) some months ago: <a href="https://github.com/livingstoneonline/LEAP-XSLT/commit/ee4ea363e6279d5cdf7fd5ae26fc7c9a20636b29">https://github.com/livingstoneonline/LEAP-XSLT/commit/ee4ea363e6279d5cdf7fd5ae26fc7c9a20636b29</a></p>
<p>Put simply, you can&#39;t have an <code>&lt;hr/&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> because it violates HTML rules. There was an <code>&lt;hr/&gt;</code> higher up in each of the top paragraphs in the two cases. So I adjust the XSLT to render the <code>&lt;hr/&gt;</code> in a different way based on the solution Nigel previously implemented.</p>
